Assignment #3 
1. Download 4 Canadian credit card bank statements of yours (August 2025 to May 
2025) 
1.1 Use template extraction to automatically extract all fields in transactions 
including transaction date, transaction postdate, transaction description, spend 
category and amount (data extraction not to be done manually) into an array data 
structure. 
1.2 Build one visualization tool that allows each month (May 2025, June 2025, July 
2025, and August 2025) to be selected so that its spend report is viewed/displayed. 
1.3 Build a regression machine learning model that accurately predicts the total 
spend for each transaction (no overfitting). 
1.4 Build a classification machine learning model that categorizes each transaction 
description. 
1.5 Use all the features of the database in your models (encode non-numerical 
features where necessary). 
1.6 Create a Github repository for your code and results. 
1.7 Submit the results both as Python code, and .pdf in the drop box, grant me 
permission to the Github repository and post the results of your project on LinkedIn. 
No Ai generated code, thank you. 
Happy coding folks!
